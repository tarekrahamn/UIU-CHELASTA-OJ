        <p>UIUoJ is a project joining people interested in and taking part in programming contests.
           On one hand, UIUoJ is a social network dedicated to programming and programming contests.
            On the other hand, it is a platform where contests are held regularly, the participant's 
            skills are reflected by their rating and the former contests can be used to prepare. 
            UIUoJ constantly develops and we plan to improve the platform to give the participants
             the opportunity to organize their own contests, filling the project with learning content,
              developing UIUoJ as a training and learning platform.</p>

        <p>Contests are regularly held on UIUoJ. Participating in them is free and open to 
          everybody. Every month we organize approximately five contests. To participate, you have
           to be registered on the site and no need to register for the oncoming contest.</p>

        <p>
          We don't have a clear Great UIUoJ Code of Conduct. However, of course, here you 
          should behave in accordance with traditional rules of behavior in public places and 
          theme groups. The following rules are, of course, necessary to follow:
          <ol>
            <li>Don't create more than one account.</li>
            <li>Do not use harsh, rude, or misleading handle.</li>
            <li>Do not use anybody's photo except yours. It is uncultured and could confuse UIUoJ users.</li>
            <li>Don't be rude, don't insult other participants and administration, try to be polite and pleasant to communicate with.</li>
            <li>When you take part in individual contests, don't talk about the problems with other contestants, don't use somebody else's code or insert it into your solutions. If the contest is a team one, discuss the tasks only with the teammates.</li>
            <li>Don't publish or spread your solutions and solution ideas during the contest.</li>
        </ol>

        <summary class = "drop4"><img src="assets/images/icon-plus.svg" class = "images4">What languages can I use to solve problems here? Are there any problem solving examples?</summary>
        <p>
          At the present time the system is configured to support the following programming 
          languages (the compilation and/or the launching line is shown for each language):
          <ol>
            <li>  GNU C  </li>

            <li>  GNU C++  </li>

      <details>
        <summary class = "drop3"><img src="assets/images/icon-plus.svg" class = "images3">What are the rules of the contests?</summary>
        <p>
          They are usually held according to the original UIUoJ rules. 
          If it is specially stated, then the International Collegiate Programming Contest 
          rules ACM-ICPC or some other modifications can be used. In brief, on the contests 
          held by UIUoJ rules you write solutions to the problems that are tested during 
          the contest on a very small number of tests. Those who have passed that set of solution
           tests, their authors can block (refuse to resend the solutions of this task in future
            even if they find a mistake). Such authors receive the opportunity to look through 
            the sources of other contestants, look for mistakes there and suggest the tests on which
             these solutions do not work. Thus, you can hack somebody else's solution and earn 
             points through it.
  After the contest all the solutions that have passed the pretests and haven't been hacked
   are tested on the final set of tests. The value of a task decreases during the contest 
   (the faster you solve the problem, the more points you receive), unsuccessful hacks take
    off the points and the successful ones add them. Please take a look at the detailed 
    version of the rules before participating in the contest.
